                        Modern cyber attackers are evolving rapidly, and one of the trends we’re
                        seeing at Vijilan is the dramatic rise in malware-free attacks. These
                        sophisticated threats leverage legitimate tools and processes already present
                        in your environment, making them incredibly difficult to detect using traditional
                        security approaches. Unlike conventional malware-based attacks that deploy
                        malicious files to your systems, malware-free attacks—also known as “living off
                        the land” attacks—use trusted programs and system utilities to carry out their
                        objectives. This makes them nearly invisible to signature-based detection
                        systems and presents a significant challenge for security teams worldwide.

                        Understanding the Malware-Free Attack Landscape
                    </h2>

                    <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                        In our analysis of over 10,000 security incidents in the past year, Vijilan’s SOC
                        team has observed a 300% increase in malware-free attack attempts. These
                        attacks typically follow a predictable pattern:

                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-300 mb-6">
                        <li>Initial Access: Attackers gain entry through compromised credentials, phishing, or exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities.</li>
                        <li>Privilege Escalation: Using legitimate Windows tools like PowerShell, WMI, or scheduled tasks to gain higher-level access.</li>
                        <li>Lateral Movement: Leveraging built-in networking tools and protocols to move through your environment.</li>
                        <li>Data Exfiltration: Using legitimate file transfer utilities or cloud services to steal sensitive information.</li>

                            exactly what makes them so effective — and so challenging to defend against.”

                        Why Traditional Security Fails Against These Threats
                    </h2>

                    <p className="text-gray-300">
                        Traditional antivirus and endpoint protection solutions rely heavily on
                        signature-based detections — looking for known malicious files and patterns.
                        But when attackers use legitimate tools like PowerShell, Windows Management
                        Instrumentation (WMI), or even trusted applications like browsers and productivity
                        software, these signature-based approaches become largely ineffective.
